# HaskellKoans
Project for the Functional Programming course @ CIn/UFPE - Spring 2018 


## The project
Koans are a widespread technique to learn about new programming languages. Inspired by [clojureScript koans](http://clojurescriptkoans.com) we decided to make a web Haskell Koans, where programmers can easily take haskell for a test-drive and see what the buzz is all about.

## To Do
- [x] Implement the koans response logic
- [ ] Connect the website to a remote database [In Progress - see branch]
- [ ] Host website 


## Setup
In order to run Haskell Koans locally, you need to:

1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate to the project's folder on Terminal/Cmd
3. Install [Happstack](http://happstack.com/page/view-page-slug/2/download):
4. Compile and run the project: 
  `runhaskell main.hs`
5. Open a browser on http://localhost:8000
